  Description
%p
  Extensions are best described as a namespaced collection of executable files
  called 'actions'.

%h2
  Actions
%p
  Actions can comprise scripts and/or binaries. The key requirement is that their file type is recognized as executable by your operating system. However, as a precaution, BDSM restrains them just a little bit further:

%p
  A valid extension must always provide at least a 'help' action. (How else could it be a useful, worthy slave?)

%p
  Want to train some slaves yourself? As an
  %a{:href => "/development/extensions/"}
    extension developer,
  you can write in any language that runs on the machine you are
  targeting.

%p
  Actions are located within an extension's bin/ directory.
%p
  Actions are exposed for your every command via the bdsm command-line in this general format:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    user$ bdsm [bdsm options] &lt;extension&gt; &lt;action&gt; [extension arguments]

%p
  Any options you pass at the end of the command are communicated to the
  particular action via a specific exported environment variable.
%p
  So, no matter the native language an action is written in, everything it needs to know to perform its job obediently and with alacrity is available to it in one simple, standardized way: by reading its process environment.

%h2
  Installing
%p
  At the moment, there's just one straightforward way to install new extensions into bdsm: you simply summon them from the main repository, via bdsm's command-line interface. (For your convenience [and amusement], we're also developing some other future methods for extension installation, too.)

%p
  Here's how it goes. First,
   we pull the extension repository down to your local system,
%pre.code
  :preserve
    root# bdsm get head; bdsm sets update all ; bdsm ext update all

%p
  Internal extensions (found at https://github.com/wayneeseguin/bdsm-extensions)
  are installed by default right along with BDSM.

%p
  Additionally, you can also add your own custom extension directories, by copying them to the
  external extensions directory tree ("$bdsm_path/extensions/external/").

%h2
  Updating
%p
  Updating your extensions from the main bdsm repository is just as simple as a quick flick o' the cat:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    root# bdsm ext update &lt;extension_name&gt;
