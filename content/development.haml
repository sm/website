%p
  Before developing contributions for BDSM's core, extensions or site, be sure to setup your BDSM development environment first.
  After
  %a{:href => "/bdsm/install"}
    installing BDSM
  on your system, while logged into your regular user account, you can setup the BDSM development environment with one command.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    bdsm core dev setup
%p
  This command sets up:
  %ul
    %li
      \~/.bdsmrc file contents
    %li
      BDSM project module interactive component, the commands
      %ul
        %li p - Change directory to given project / subproject.
        %li pe - Change directory to given project / subproject, and open it in your $EDITOR (vim if no EDITOR has been set).
        %li po - Change directory to given project / subproject, and open it in the filesystem viewer.
    %li
      Core, extensions and site repositories are placed in the projects path (by default, $HOME/projects/bdsm/).

  As soon as the command completes, you can open a new shell and start using the project functions.
  For example, to switch directories to BDSM's core, and start editing it, just type:
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      user ~/ $ pe bdsm core
      user ~/projects/bdsm/ $   # Editor also launched here

  The p, pe and po commands operate on a prefix basis; the shortest match wins.
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      user ~/ $ pe bd c
      user ~/projects/bdsm/core $  # Editor also launched here
